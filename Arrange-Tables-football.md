# Arrange Tables In-Class Exercises - College Football edition

The goal of this exercise is to gain experience thinking about data types and proposing chart idioms appropriate for that data.
 
## Instructions
* We'll gather in to groups of 3-4 students per Zoom breakout room.
* Given the following sets of data, propose idioms that could be used to answer the associated questions/tasks.  Justify your choices for each by listing
  * data items and marks used to encode those data items
  * data attributes, their data types, and the channels used to encode those attributes
* *Sketch* (no programming needs to be involved) what the chart might look like (you don't have to include exact data points)
* When we gather back together in the main Zoom room, I'll ask you to share your sketch (either by camera or screen sharing)

## Exercise

I'll give you 15 minutes for each part.  After each 15 minutes, we'll gather back in the main room to briefly discuss your proposed idioms.

### Part A 
Les Miles was the head coach at LSU between 2005-2016.  Starting in 2019, he became the head coach at Kansas.  For the following questions, ignore any data from the current year as it's just partial data.  Also ignore his partial year at LSU (he was fired before the 2016 season had completed).
